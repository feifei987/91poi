Description
RASS (Random Assembly Stocastic Search) is a Python program for facilitating a stochastic search for any type of molecular structure. This approach refines Saunders' seminal "Kick" procedure, but adds restrictions on what constitutes an acceptable candidate structure. These restrictions are that no pair of atoms in a candidate structure can exhibit distances less than the sum of their combined covalent radii, and that each atom in a candidate structure must be connected to every other atom by a network of bonds (where bonds are defined based on atomic covalent radii). These restrictions are enforced during RASS's unique candidate structure assembly process.
